#blackjack

In this project, my pair and I made a Backbone.js-based Blackjack game using the CoffeeScript. We implemented the core BlackJack rules, including casino chips and allowing the user to split or double.

The most challenging part of this project was using a learning and using a new programming language (Coffeescript) with Backjone.js, which is a front-end framework that we also just learned in the previous sprint. Exposing ourselves to different languages helped changed the way we solved and thought about problems. Doing so forced us to think about software engineering separately from the constraints of specific implementations; and we learned to think about programming in a more general way.

####Note
This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.
